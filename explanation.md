#### print: 
This is fairly simple, it prints the variable/integer/string in the parenthesis. 

####[var] = input([string]): 
taking user input and assigning it to a variable.

#### if [var] == 'string' or [var] == 'string': 
if the inputted text for the variable is 'string' do the following.

#### print('f(' + str(terms) + ') = f(' + str(terms - 1) + ') ' + '+' + ' ' + str(numb)):
Follows the base recursive formula and adds the variables needed. It's a mess of code but it works.

#### while terms > 0:
####    terms = terms - 1
####    sn = sn + numb
While the terms variable is over 0, (prevents negative integers that would break the program) the terms variable goes down by 1, 
and the sn variable = the sn variable plus the numb variable.

#### print(sn)
prints the final number
